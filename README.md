## Object-oriented programming 1 - cpp

This course is a continuation of the Basics of Object-Oriented Programming, where I learned the fundamentals of C++ and object-oriented programming. In this subject, I developed programming skills in the C++ language and learned about concepts such as operator overloading, inheritance, copy and move constructors (as well as move and copy operators), polymorphism, abstract classes, exception handling, function and class templates, the STL library, and other topics related to object-oriented programming. You can find here all the solved programs and tasks from the laboratories.

## Basics of computer graphics - grafika

This subject helped me build knowledge about graphic algorithms and taught me how to use the SFML and WxWidgets libraries. In this repository, you can find some of the solved laboratory assignments. I also participated in a group project related to this course, which you can find here: https://github.com/skolanko222/grafika_projekt.git

## Python language - python

In this course, I learned the fundamentals of the Python language, including data structures, string formatting, functions, lambda expressions, generators, file operations, exception handling, classes, iterators, decorators, and how to interface with C language. This repository contains solved programs from the labs.

## Numerical methods - metody_numeryczne

This course introduced me to basic numerical methods, both in theory and practical application in programs. In the laboratories, we used C++ and the GSL library to solve various numerical problems. You can find all the solutions for the assignments in this repository.

## TO DO:
metody numeryczne: lab8, lab9, lab10, lab11, lab12, lab13 <br />
cpp: lab9, lab10, lab11, lab12 <br /> 
python: lab9, lab10, lab11, lab12, lab13, lab14, lab15 <br />
